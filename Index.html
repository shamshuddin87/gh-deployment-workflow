# Simple Workflow for Deploying Static Content to GitHub Pages

This repository uses GitHub Actions to deploy static content to GitHub Pages automatically when changes are pushed to the `main` branch or when the workflow is manually triggered. The process includes checking out the repository, configuring GitHub Pages, uploading the static content, and deploying it to GitHub Pages.

## Workflow Overview

The workflow consists of a single job that deploys the contents of the repository to GitHub Pages. Here’s an overview of how the process works:

1. **Trigger**: The workflow runs on:
   - Every push to the `main` branch.
   - Manual triggers from the Actions tab (via `workflow_dispatch`).
   
2. **Permissions**: The workflow grants the `GITHUB_TOKEN` specific permissions to read repository contents and write to GitHub Pages.

3. **Concurrency**: Only one deployment is allowed at a time, and if another deployment is queued while one is in progress, the new deployment will wait until the current one finishes.

4. **Steps**:
   - **Checkout the repository**: Uses `actions/checkout@v4` to pull the latest code from the repository.
   - **Set up GitHub Pages**: Uses `actions/configure-pages@v5` to configure GitHub Pages.
   - **Upload the static content**: The `actions/upload-pages-artifact@v3` action uploads the repository’s contents to be deployed.
   - **Deploy to GitHub Pages**: Finally, `actions/deploy-pages@v4` deploys the content to GitHub Pages.

## Workflow File Explanation

The following YAML file is used for the deployment workflow (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`):

```yaml
name: Deploy static content to Pages

on:
  # Runs on pushes targeting the default branch
  push:
    branches: ["main"]

  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
  workflow_dispatch:

permissions:
  contents: read
  pages: write
  id-token: write

concurrency:
  group: "pages"
  cancel-in-progress: false

jobs:
  deploy:
    environment:
      name: github-pages
      url: ${{ steps.deployment.outputs.page_url }}
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Setup Pages
        uses: actions/configure-pages@v5
      - name: Upload artifact
        uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v3
        with:
          path: '.'
      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
        id: deployment
        uses: actions/deploy-pages@v4
